# This is a new package, it is under development,is an experimental, and my first thanks for understanding👍

if you want to here is a sample to do in RunKit

`var test = require("emoji-startup-package") (new line)
var string = 'all is working' (new line)
var send = test(string) (new line)
console.log(send) (new line)`

**[MODIFY THE CODE]** if you want to change the emoji then go into your directiory where you have it installed then node_modules\@eggsnham07/package_first\main.js you can change the code so you have different emojis in there
